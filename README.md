This project was made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using the basic template.


`yarn start` to serve locally while in development.

`npm run deploy` builds a production version and sends to gh-pages branch on remote (still need to push main repo as normal)

App uses [Single Page Apps for GitHub Pages](https://github.com/rafgraph/spa-github-pages) to solve the issues with client-side rendering

To investigate - https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet might be an answer to updating metadata/titles etc
