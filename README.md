This project was made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using the basic template.


`yarn start` to serve locally while in development.

`npm run deploy` builds a production version and sends to gh-pages branch on remote (still need to push main repo as normal)

Current workaround for direct URL browsing is to duplicate index.html at 404.html, since GitHub will sever a 404 page for mikeolivotto.com/whatever
